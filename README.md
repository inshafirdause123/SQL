üß© Project Overview

This project analyzes a library database containing detailed book information such as title, author, category, storage location (cabinet, rack, row), signal strength, status, and timestamps of when books were added.

The dataset (library_dataset_random 2.csv) is imported into MySQL and used to perform both basic and advanced SQL queries involving filtering, aggregation, subqueries, window functions, and date-time analysis.
